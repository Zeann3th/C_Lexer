# C_Lexer

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

An attempt to make a C lexer in Go. Not quite polished and fully functional but from this, i can learn how to make a lexer, and maybe a parser and compiler in the near future... 

About learning sources, i watched:
- Tsoding's [Military Grade C/C++ Lexer from Scratch](https://youtu.be/AqyZztKlSGQ?si=8VvN0P8PbarUr3Rb)
- Tsoding's [Ok, i made C compiler in PHP (c.php Ep.01](https://youtu.be/Yi6NxMxCFY8?si=5msG4qRTffHirmnY)
- LLVM's [Kaleidoscope: kaleidoscope Introduction and the Lexer](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl01.html)

## ðŸ”¨ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Golang version >= 1.22.5

### Running

In the directory that you put the project directory on, type this following command in the terminal:

```bash
cd .\C_Lexer\cmd\compiler

```

Use your favorite text/code editor (I use neovim btw) and open main.go file in the same directory.

The main() function should look like this:

```go
func main() {
	fileName := "internal/example/hello.c"

	source, err := os.ReadFile(fileName)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(fmt.Sprintf("[FILEIO]: ERROR: Failed to open file <%v>", fileName))
	}
	Tokenize(source)

	// Parse(source)
}

```

NB:
- You can change the fileName variable to the path of your C file.
- Tokenize() will read your C file and tokenize it in to tokens defined in `internal/lexer/token.go`: 

```go
const (
	UNDEFINED TokenKind = iota
	PREPROCESSOR
	COMMENT
	KEYWORD
	TYPE
	VAR
	FUNC
	OPAREN
	CPAREN
	OCURLY
	CCURLY
	NUMBER
	STRING
	CHAR
	RETURN
	EOF
	ERROR
	// Logical operations
	ASSIGN
	NOT
	NOTEQ
	EQ
	LT
	GT
	LTE
	GTE
	ADD
	SUB
	MUL
	DIV
	// Punctuation
	SEMICOLON
	COMMA
	DOT
)

```

- Parse() will parse all of the tokens and put them in expressions, statements and declarations to form an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Let's get to the fun part, in the terminal, same directory, run this command (Make sure you have go installed):

```bash
go run main.go
```

## ðŸ“– Example

This is the hello.c file:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int a = 0;
  printf("%d", a);
  printf("Hello World!!!\n");
  printf("This is a number: %d\n", 10);
  printf("This is also a number but in decimals: %lf\n", 1.2968);
}
```

After tokenization, it should return:
